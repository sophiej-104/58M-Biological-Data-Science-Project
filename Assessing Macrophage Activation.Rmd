# Introduction
Macrophages are mononuclear cells with high phagocytic activity, [@Schnyder1978-er]. They have key roles in the immune responses, particularly the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the phagocytosis of microorganisms, [@Murray2005-ei]. 

Phagocytosis is a major function of the macrophage, not only for pathogens, but also for the resolution of inflammation through the phagocytosis of other immune cells, such as neutrophils, [@Newman1982-of].

The necrosis of tumours in response to bacterial-endotoxins was first determined to be an indirect process by, [@OMalley1962-lb], in which the necrosis could be triggered by a serum, derived from animals treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), in animals not exposed to LPS. This was deemed to be mediated by a "tumour necrotizing factor" later determined to be a superfamily that includes the protein Tumour Necrosis Factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$). 

Understanding the mechanisms by which macrophages are activated, and their subsequent production of TNF-$\alpha$, is important for aiding research into chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, [@Plevy1997-fw]. Uncontrolled macrophage activation is noted to be key in such chronic inflammatory diseases, [@Sindrilaru2011-qj], with TNF-$\alpha$ being classed as a proinflammatory macrophage marker. 

The aim of this study is to gain understanding of the mechanisms by which macrophages are activated/respond and produce TNF-$\alpha$, specifically with regards to the necessity of phagocytosis in the production of TNF-$\alpha$.
