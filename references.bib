  abstract = "Macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage from untreated
              mice or from mice which had received either Brewer's
              thioglycollate broth or a suspension of streptococcus A cell
              walls intraperitoneally 4 days before. 3 h after harvesting,
              adherent cells from untreated mice were allowed to phagocytose
              zymosan, formaldehyde-treated sheep erythrocytes, or latex beads.
              Phagocytosis was stopped after 1 h and culture was continued for
              up to 10 days. Phagocytosis of zymosan or sheep erythrocytes
              triggered the immediate release of lysosomal glycosidases,
              stimulated the synthesis of cellular lactate dehydrogenase, and
              induced the delayed production and secretion of plasminogen
              activator . No such changes were observed upon phagocytosis of
              latex. Although all three particles used were phagocytosed, only
              zymosan and sheep erythrocytes stimulated glucose oxidation via
              the hexose monophosphate shunt. Similar findings were obtained in
              macrophages elicited with streptococcus A cell walls after
              zymosan phagocytosis. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages,
              however, which were already secreting lysosomal hydrolases and
              plasminogen activator, could not be activated further by zymosan.
              The results of this study show that macrophages become activated
              after phagocytosis of particles that stimulate the activity of
              their hexose monophosphate shunt. The triggering event appears to
              be the burst of shunt activity itself or shunt-related
              biochemical reactions rather than phagocytic uptake per se or
              particle-dependent complement activation by the alternative
              pathway. Once initiated, macrophage activation proceeds
              independently of the intracellular fate of the ingested material
              .",

              recognize and ingest senescent polymorphonuclear neutrophils has
              been used that uses chromium-labeled neutrophils and staining for
              myeloperoxidase (MPO). Human monocyte-derived macrophages
              obtained from in vitro cultures were able to recognize ``aged''
              but not freshly isolated 51Cr-labeled human neutrophils and
              ingest them. Freshly isolated monocytes did not exhibit this
              property. Because the aged neutrophils were greater than 95\%
              viable, death did not appear to be a prerequisite for recognition
              and ingestion. Serum was not required for the aging of the
              neutrophils, and when serum was used, different concentrations
              did not appear to effect the aging process; that is, neutrophils
              aged in different concentrations of serum were ingested equally.
              Phagocytosis of senescent neutrophils by macrophages occurred in
              a time-dependent manner and was also dependent on the number of
              neutrophils added. Monocyte-derived macrophages first exhibited
              the ability to phagocytose senescent neutrophils on the 3rd d of
              culture, with the percentage of active macrophages increasing
              through day 7. In experiments with rabbit mononuclear phagocytes,
              immune complex-induced inflammatory macrophages from the lung but
              not resident bronchoalveolar macrophages or peripheral blood
              monocytes were found to be capable of recognition and ingestion
              of senescent rabbit neutrophils. These data suggest that the
              monocyte maturation process, akin to that seen during
              inflammation, is necessary in vitro before macrophages recognize
              and remove senescent neutrophils.",

              lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) Th1 production were

              effects of cA2 on cytokine production, TNF-alpha- and
              IFN-gamma-producing cells were quantitated in LPMC from five
              Crohn's disease patients treated with cA2. In all four patients

              numbers of LPMC producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha following
              CD2/CD28 activation paralleled improvement in disease activity

              diseases such as atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and chronic
              venous leg ulcers. However, it is still unclear which
              environmental cues induce persistent activation of macrophages in
              vivo and how macrophage-derived effector molecules maintain
              chronic inflammation and affect resident fibroblasts essential
              for tissue homeostasis and repair. We used a complementary
              approach studying human subjects with chronic venous leg ulcers,
              a model disease for macrophage-driven chronic inflammation, while
              establishing a mouse model closely reflecting its pathogenesis.
              Here, we have shown that iron overloading of macrophages--as was
              found to occur in human chronic venous leg ulcers and the mouse
              model--induced a macrophage population in situ with an
              unrestrained proinflammatory M1 activation state. Via enhanced
              TNF-$\alpha$ and hydroxyl radical release, this macrophage
              population perpetuated inflammation and induced a
              p16(INK4a)-dependent senescence program in resident fibroblasts,
              eventually leading to impaired wound healing. This study provides
              insight into the role of what we believe to be a previously
              undescribed iron-induced macrophage population in vivo. Targeting
              this population may hold promise for the development of novel
