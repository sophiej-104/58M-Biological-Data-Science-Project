  abstract = "Macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage from untreated
              mice or from mice which had received either Brewer's
              thioglycollate broth or a suspension of streptococcus A cell
              walls intraperitoneally 4 days before. 3 h after harvesting,
              adherent cells from untreated mice were allowed to phagocytose
              zymosan, formaldehyde-treated sheep erythrocytes, or latex beads.
              Phagocytosis was stopped after 1 h and culture was continued for
              up to 10 days. Phagocytosis of zymosan or sheep erythrocytes
              triggered the immediate release of lysosomal glycosidases,
              stimulated the synthesis of cellular lactate dehydrogenase, and
              induced the delayed production and secretion of plasminogen
              activator . No such changes were observed upon phagocytosis of
              latex. Although all three particles used were phagocytosed, only
              zymosan and sheep erythrocytes stimulated glucose oxidation via
              the hexose monophosphate shunt. Similar findings were obtained in
              macrophages elicited with streptococcus A cell walls after
              zymosan phagocytosis. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages,
              however, which were already secreting lysosomal hydrolases and
              plasminogen activator, could not be activated further by zymosan.
              The results of this study show that macrophages become activated
              after phagocytosis of particles that stimulate the activity of
              their hexose monophosphate shunt. The triggering event appears to
              be the burst of shunt activity itself or shunt-related
              biochemical reactions rather than phagocytic uptake per se or
              particle-dependent complement activation by the alternative
              pathway. Once initiated, macrophage activation proceeds
              independently of the intracellular fate of the ingested material
              .",

              myeloperoxidase (MPO). Human monocyte-derived macrophages
              obtained from in vitro cultures were able to recognize ``aged''
              but not freshly isolated 51Cr-labeled human neutrophils and
              ingest them. Freshly isolated monocytes did not exhibit this
              property. Because the aged neutrophils were greater than 95\%
              viable, death did not appear to be a prerequisite for recognition
              and ingestion. Serum was not required for the aging of the
              neutrophils, and when serum was used, different concentrations
              did not appear to effect the aging process; that is, neutrophils
              aged in different concentrations of serum were ingested equally.
              Phagocytosis of senescent neutrophils by macrophages occurred in
              a time-dependent manner and was also dependent on the number of
              neutrophils added. Monocyte-derived macrophages first exhibited
              the ability to phagocytose senescent neutrophils on the 3rd d of
              culture, with the percentage of active macrophages increasing
              through day 7. In experiments with rabbit mononuclear phagocytes,
              immune complex-induced inflammatory macrophages from the lung but
              not resident bronchoalveolar macrophages or peripheral blood
              monocytes were found to be capable of recognition and ingestion
              of senescent rabbit neutrophils. These data suggest that the
              monocyte maturation process, akin to that seen during
              inflammation, is necessary in vitro before macrophages recognize
              and remove senescent neutrophils.",

              environmental cues induce persistent activation of macrophages in
              vivo and how macrophage-derived effector molecules maintain
              chronic inflammation and affect resident fibroblasts essential
              for tissue homeostasis and repair. We used a complementary
              approach studying human subjects with chronic venous leg ulcers,
              a model disease for macrophage-driven chronic inflammation, while
              establishing a mouse model closely reflecting its pathogenesis.
              Here, we have shown that iron overloading of macrophages--as was
              found to occur in human chronic venous leg ulcers and the mouse
              model--induced a macrophage population in situ with an
              unrestrained proinflammatory M1 activation state. Via enhanced

              bioinformatics to flow cytometry data, which involves storing,
              retrieving, organizing, and analyzing flow cytometry data using
              extensive computational resources and tools. Flow cytometry
              bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the
              development of techniques from computational statistics and
              machine learning. Flow cytometry and related methods allow the
              quantification of multiple independent biomarkers on large
              numbers of single cells. The rapid growth in the
              multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data,
              particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety
              of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public
              databases for the sharing of results. Computational methods exist
              to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data,
              identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell
              populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and
              discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing,
              this includes compensating for spectral overlap, transforming
              data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis,
              assessing data for quality, and normalizing data across samples
              and experiments. For population identification, tools are
              available to aid traditional manual identification of populations
              in two-dimensional scatter plots (gating), to use dimensionality
              reduction to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in
              higher dimensional space in a variety of ways. It is also
              possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as
              the density-guided binary space partitioning technique known as
              probability binning, or by combinatorial gating. Finally,
              diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised
              learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of
              biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as
              part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned
              methods. Open standards, data, and software are also key parts of
              flow cytometry bioinformatics. Data standards include the widely
              adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from
              cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under
              development by the International Society for Advancement of
              Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information
              about experimental design and analytical steps. Open data is
              slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010
              and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely
              distribute their data, and the latter of which has been
              recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant
              data by ISAC. Open software is most widely available in the form
